## 🔍 Problem Statement

Today’s placement prep journey is broken:

- **Fragmented workflow** – Students switch between 6–7 platforms (resume builders, LeetCode, Notion, job boards).
- **Manual effort** – Tailoring resumes/cover letters, organizing job applications, and prepping interviews is tedious.
- **Lack of context** – Current AI tools generate outputs without deep understanding of your background.
- **Job discovery fatigue** – Scammy or outdated job posts waste time and destroy motivation.
